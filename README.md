# Oxfam-Inspire

>Oxfam Inspire is a template Android app for charitable non-profit humanitarian organizations to use as their alternative fund raising stream.

It serves as a platform to show projects that users can donate to instantly (and socially with their friends) through an app that encourages small donations.

Although originally developed in sync with Oxfam India, this app was unfortunately never put into production to my slight sadness. For this reason, the app is still somewhat incomplete, in that it cannot connect to the internet properly.

**However, if there is interest in this project by a charitable org. please send me an email, and I'll be extremely happy to put in my time to finish this project in a week's time.**

Always grateful to be part of humanitarian efforts in whatever way.
